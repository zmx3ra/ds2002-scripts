I was on git bash because my ubuntu SSH key was giving me issues and I wanted to follow along. But then, I dont know what happened but 20 minutes into class I did something and my git is broken. I reinstalled it 3 times and restarted my computer. Nothing was working. No command was working. I tried everything through chat. So then I figured out my SSH key after my failed attempts of fixing git bash. I now am pushing this file so you can understand why it looks like I did none of the classwork.
